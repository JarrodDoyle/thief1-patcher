                       =     Version 2.20    =


=    Overview    =

This program is a graphical interface for converting .3ds files into the Dark Engine's native .bin format, allowing you to easily import custom objects and creatures into DromEd. It includes features for easily scaling, rotating, translating and retexturing the object, and can also attempt to automatically fix incomplete joint and vhot data. It can also call upon the power of Shadowspawn's Free The Objects toolkit to convert .bin files back to .e or .3ds format, and use Shadowspawn's MeshUp utility to convert creature meshes to revision 2.0 format.
The also allows you to view a preview of the object you're working on via the Looking Glass Object Viewer utility, which can be accessed by pressing Alt+V (or Alt+Shift+V for fullscreen, high colour mode). You cannot view objects that will not compile to .bin format.

This program has been most thoroughly tested with Thief Gold and Thief 2, both under Windows 2000 and Windows XP. However, it should work with System Shock 2 (and other versions of Windows) as well.



=   Installing   =

Unzip the program to the directory of your choice.

For the program to be able to function, you must have the following files:

	3ds2e.exe or n3ds2e.exe
	BSP.exe
	MeshBld.exe
	View.exe	(Optional)

These programs should be in your Thief or SS2 folder. If you do not have them, you can download them from here:
http://www.geocities.com/nameless_voice/Downloads/Tools/ObjectTools.zip (642k)

In order to use the program for meshes, you must also extract all the .map and .mjo files from your Mesh.crf, along with the following .cal files:

	conbase.cal
	burrbase.cal
	manbase.cal

These files must all be extracted to the same location. It's probably best to create a new folder to put them into.
In order to create Revision 2 meshes (which allow glowing faces, transparency, and the use of the Mesh Textures property), you will need Shadowspawn's MeshFix pack:

	MeshUp.exe	(Optional)

If you do not have these tools, you can downloaded them from here:
http://www.geocities.com/nameless_voice/Downloads/Tools/MeshFix.zip (45k)


In addition, you will need Shadowspawn's Free The Object's Toolkit in order to open .bin files and save .3ds files:

	BinToE.exe	(Optional)
	ETo3ds.exe	(Optional)

If you do not have these tools, you can downloaded them from here:
http://www.geocities.com/nameless_voice/Downloads/Tools/FreeTheObjects3.zip (196k)

If you have enough disk space, you should extract Obj.crf to a subfolder of your Obj folder named 'Original', as this will allow the program to display original LGS textures when they are used in a model. The same should also be done for Mesh.crf.
Only the textures files (txt and txt16) are required, but once the .bin .e files have been extracted they can be opened and converted to .3ds if you have the Free The Objects Toolkit.

If you are using Windows 98, you may want to place the shortcut file in your Windows\Pif folder.
If you do not have the Visual Basic runtime libraries, you will need to download them.
If you do not have 3ds2e.exe, BSP.exe and MeshBld.exe, you must download them from the address above, or from http://www.thief-thecircle.com



=   How to use   =

Once you have loaded the program, you will need to direct it to the .3ds file that you wish to convert. If a find dialogue does not appear when you launch the program due to the program's configuration (see below), use the 'Open' button to select this file.
If the file appears to be a mesh, you will be prompted as to whether it should be treated as one.
Once the file has been loaded, you can modify the materials, set the scale factor, and make other adjustments.

When you are satisfied with your changes, press the'Go!' button to finish the conversion proccess.

If you wish to discard any changes you've made and reopen the file, you can use the the 'Reload' button.

You can also save the current model in .e and .3ds* format, and open .e and .bin* files.

* These formats requrie Shadowspawn's Free The Objects Toolkit.
See the documentation for these programs for more information on opening .bin files.

Finally, you can use the Package button to copy all of the files required for an object to a specific location on your drive.



I will now give a short description of some of the program's options.

 *	Centre Object
If this option is enabled, the object's centroid will be placed at the object's exact centre.

 *	Open .e file
If this option is enabled, the .e file will be opened in Notepad before the file is converted to .bin format, to allow you to make manual modifications.
To specify an alternate text editor you need to manually add the 'Notepad' setting under '[Locations]' in 3ds2bin.ini.
For example:
[Locations]
Notepad=C:\Program Files\Notepad++\Notepad++.exe

 *	Verbose Mode
If this option is enabled, the program will give you additional information on the object, such as the joint setup, after it has been converted.

* Fix Joint Names
The @ symbol, used in the .e file to specify a special object, such as a joint or a vhot, cannot be used in certain 3D applications. Some programs, such as AccuTrans 3D, will replace this 'invalid' character with an underscore (_). If this option is enabled, object names that sound like joints, but begin with an underscore, will have this underscore replaced with an @ symbol.

 *	Fix Joint Data
If enabled, the program will attempt to remove excessive vertixes and faces from an object's joints. Although this can be very useful for 3D modelling software which cannot cope with objects with less than three sides (Caligari trueSpace, for example), this option does not work perfectly, so you may be forced to do this manually.

 *	Auto .gif Textures
When this option is enabled, the program will automatically change all texture file extensions to .gif. Of course, you still have to convert the actual file and place it into your Txt or Txt16 folder!

 *	Scale, Translate, and Rotate.
These options are fairly self-explanatory. Use them to scale, move, and rotate the object.

 *	Centroid
These options are uses to define the location of the object's centroid. If you set one to '-', the object's centroid will be placed at the object's lowest point on that axis. This will, effectively, offset the actual object in the opposite direction.
The 'Centre Object' box must be cleared to use these offsetting features.

 *	Comment
You can use the Comment box to change the comment header in the .e file. As this comment is not included in the finished .bin file, it's fairly trivial.

 *	Group Name
You can use these boxes to rename any of the object's polygon groups.

 *	Material Name
You can use these boxes to rename any of the object's material groups.

 *	Shader
You can use these boxes to give a material either a PHONG or GOURARD shader, or both. This can make objects look more realistic.

 *	Special
You can use the Special boxes to give a material extra illumination. To do this, choose Illum in the first box, then enter the amount that you want the material illuminated, as a percentage, into the second box.
Negative illumination does not seem to be supported.
Do not use Illum on Meshes, as it crashes the old version of MeshBld we have.

 *	Type
With these boxes, you can choose if this material is a texture map, or merely a solid RGB colour. Note that you cannot set an object that originally only had a solid RGB colour to use a texture map, as there are no texture alignment coordinates in the file.

 *	Data
You can use these boxes to specify the filename for the current material's texture, or, in the case of a solid RGB material, select the colour by clicking on the box. 
For texture maps, you can use the Texture Browser to locate a file (See below).
Texture map filenames cannot be longer than 16 characters, including the extension.

 *	???
These parameters can only be used in conjunction with texture maps, but their exact purpose is unknown.

 *	Transp
You can use these boxes to specify the transparency of a material, as a percentage.For some reason, setting this value to 100 seems to cause Bsp.exe to crash.
Note that 20 means 20% transparent, not 20% opaque.

 *	Double-sided
These boxes can be used to make a material double-sided. Double-sided materials can be seen from both sides, but also use more polygons on the screen.
The proper method of making a material double-sided is to include the 'DBL' flag. However, this doesn't seem to work for meshes, so the old-style algorithm, which duplicates every poly in the chosen group and mirrors it, has also been included. To use it, you need to hold down Ctrl+Alt and click on the number next to the group you wish to make double-sided.
Given the choice, it's probably a good idea to ues the old algorithm only if you can't use the normal method.

 *	Mesh
If checked, the current object will be treated as a mesh, otherwise it will be treated like a normal object. Although the program should detect when you are converting a mesh file, you can use this checkbox to manually override intelligent mesh/object detection.

 *	Mesh Type
This option is only availiable when converting meshes.
Use this menu to select which type of mesh you are converting. If you select an incorrect mesh type, the chances are that your object will not be converted, or possibly even crash DromEd when used.
The program tries to guess the correct mesh type, but this is far from perfect. It can never detect 'Apparition' or 'Droid' types.

 *	Texture Preview/Browser
This area shows a small thumbnail of the currently selected material. If the material is set to RGB, then a plain colour is displayed here. If the materials is set to TMAP, the texture map is displayed, if it can be found in the 'txt16', 'txt', 'original\txt16' or 'original\txt' folders appropriate to the current object type. Textures inside the 'Obj' folder will not be displayed if you are converting a mesh, and vice versa.
To browse for a texture, click on the preview area or press Ctrl-T. If the file you select is not in the correct path, you will be prompted to copy it there.
Note that if the file is not .gif format, you will need to use an external program to convert it to that format.

 *	Object Viewer
This feature allows you to view a preview of the current object by either pressing Alt-V (windowed software mode) or Alt-Shift-V (fullscreen hardware mode). Meshes are not supported.
For more information on using the object viewer, refer to the file "Object Viewer Readme.txt".
Note that the model needs to be converted to .bin format before it can be viewed, so you can't view a model that won't compile.
In order to use it, you will need the Looking Glass object tools (availiable here: http://www.geocities.com/nameless_voice/Downloads/Tools/ObjectTools.zip at a size of 642k).

 Advanced options
__________________

 *	Auto Update
If this option is enabled, the program will detect when the currently loaded .3ds file has been modified, and will ask you if you wish to reload. (Default: Enabled)
See also: Keep advanced materials when reloading .3ds (below)

 *	Automatic Incrementation
If the currently loaded .3ds file is reloaded, and the output file already exists, the program automatically adds a number to the end of the filename, and increments this number with subsequent updates. This should help you work around the problem of DromEd refusing the notice that a .bin file has changed since it was loaded into memory. (Default: Enabled)

 *	Automatic File Loading
By default, when the program starts, it automatically loads what it thinks to be the most recent .3ds file.
To disable this, select 'Start without looking for input' in the advanced options menu.
Alternatively, enter choose 'Start with file selector' to have the program automatically open a file selection dialogue, with the most recent file highlighted. (Default: Start with most recent .3ds file)

 *	Convert Meshes to Revision 2
When this option is enabled, meshes are automatically converted to revision 2 meshes, which allow illumination, transparency, and the use of the Mesh Textures property.
In order to use this feature, you need Shadowspawn's MeshFix toolkit.
At present, this program cannot apply the Illum or Trans properties to the revision 2 meshes.
(Default: Enabled if availiable)

 *	Ignore Illum when loading .3ds.
If this option is enabled, the self illumination of materials in the input .3ds file will be ignored.

 *	Invert transparency when loading .3ds
If the transparency value specified by your 3D modelling application becomes inverted by the Conversion Utility (eg; 5% opaque becomes 5% transpant), then you should enable this option; otherwise, leave it disabled.
(Default: Disabled)

 *	Keep advanced materials when reloading .3ds
If this option is enabled, the advanced material options (Transparency, Shader, Special and Double-Sided) are kept when the current .3ds file is reloaded. (Default: Enabled)

 *	Save current scale factors as default
This will save the current scale factors as default, so that the scale factors will be the same whenever you load the program.
For example, if you wish to create models in your 3D program at 10x the scale that they should be in Thief, you should set the three scale settings to "0.10" and then select 'Save current scale factors' from the Advanced options menu.

 *	Attempt to fix truncated texture filenames
Some programs, such as 3D Studio Max, truncate the texture filenames to eight characters when exporting to .3ds.
If this option is enabled, the program will attempt to find the actual texture name when it loads the .3ds file.

 *	Z-99

This feature removes all vertices beloning to a joint group which have a Z coordinate of '-99.00' (additional decimal places are ignored). This is useful if your 3D modelling software does not allow polygons with less than three vertices.
This feature will not function unless the 'Fix Joint Data' option is enabled. (Default: Enabled)

 *	Choose Skin

Opens the skin selection window, which allows you to choose a skin to apply to the program. You can also delete skins and create new skins.
Skins are kept in the "3ds to bin Skins" folder in the same path as the application.
When you choose to create a new skin, all the images will be written to a subfolder with the skin name of your choice. The files created will be bitmap images (.bmp), although the program will also accept .jpg files for everything except the three checkbox images (which must be bmp format), and the ImgNum image, which will be accepted in .bmp or .gif format.

__________________
 Troubleshooting
__________________

The Graphical .3ds -> .bin Conversion Utility keeps a log file (3ds2bin.log), which is overwritten each time the program is run. If you run into any major problems (eg. Runtime errors), send me a description of the problem and a copy of the log file, either via the TTLG Forums (Editors Guild or PM), or via email.
If you really don't like the log feature, you can disable it by adding the line LoggingDisabled=1 to the [Settings] section of 3ds2bin.ini.
